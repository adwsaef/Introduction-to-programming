# Interval Arithmetic Library

This project implements an interval arithmetic library in C. It provides a set of functions for representing and manipulating imprecise numerical values (intervals), supporting arithmetic operations and queries on these intervals.

## Features

- **Interval Representation:** Values can be represented as exact numbers, intervals.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported for both type of values (intervals, exact values).
- **Queries:** Functions to check if a value belongs to an interval, and to get the minimum, maximum, and average values of an interval.
